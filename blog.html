                    <p>The scope of the var keyword is the global scope or function scope. When we declare a variable using var keyword, it becomes globally scoped or function scoped. but let and const are block scope</p>

                    <p>If we declare a variable using var keyword outside the function, we can access it from globally (any where in our code).</p>

                    <p>And if we declare a variable using var keyword inside the function, we can access it within the function.</p>

                    <p>As let and const are block scope, they can't be accessed outside the block where they are declared. </p>

                    <p>The difference of let and const is let can be re-assigned but const can't be re-assigned. And when you declare a variable using const, you must be assigned it's value</p>

                    <span class="font-bold text-lg underline">Answer:</span>
                     <p>null and undefined are two special type of primitive data type in JavaScript. typeof null is object and typeof undefined is undefined.</p>
                     <p>null means an empty value. When we assigned null in a variable, it means the variable contains no value. In JavaScript, null is used for referring of any object value. If any function or variable returns null, then we can infer that the object couldn't be created. And if we pass null as  a default parameter to any function it would take it as a value.</p>
                     <br>
                     <p>undefined means a variable has declared but it's value has not been assigned. When we declared a variable and not initialized it's value, by default the variable stored undefined as value. Using undefined in JavaScript saves our code from showing error.</p>
                     <p>if we not return from a function, it returns by default undefined. And if we take a parameter in a function but not provide it's value as argument, the parameter's value will undefined.</p>

                    <p>REST stands for REpresentation State Transfer. A REST API is an architectural style for an application programming interface that used for exchanging data between client-server applications. That data can be used to GET, POST, UPDATE and DELETE data types. REST API is known as RESTful API.</p>
